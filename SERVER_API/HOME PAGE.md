Welcome to the S.E.T.H. (Server for Encrypted Transfer and Hosting) API. This API document outlines all features of the S.E.T.H. system, how to customize it, and contains detailed information about most notable features (in-development or currently active). This API also includes information about security features as well as how to interact with a server and set it up for personal use.

Some pages to get started on:
* [[USER PERMISSIONS]] - various user permissions, outlining what they can and cannot do (by default).
* [[LIST OF ALL COMMANDS]] - a comprehensive list of all commands (including hidden backend commands), and what exactly is sent over the connection.
* [[DEVLOG]] - a document that keeps track of development progress and contains brain dumps/ideas for the server.


USEFUL FORMATTING:
```java
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```
